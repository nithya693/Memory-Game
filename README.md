# Memory-Game

This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons. 

## How to play the game:

* The player randomly flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* Then the player turns over the second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Winning Criteria:

* The player has to match all the cards perfectly.
* The player has to complete the game as quick as possible. Timer will start once the player starts the game.
* The player has to finish the game in minimum moves to get a good rating.
* Rating will be provided as stars based on the time taken and the number of moves.
